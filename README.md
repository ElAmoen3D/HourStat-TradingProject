# HOURSTAT PATTERN FINDER
The script should iterate through a CSV of NQ prices of any date, find places in which a previous hour's low
is swept within the first 20 minutes, and determine if the price returns.

# IMPORTANT - INPUT CSV IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS REPOSITORY!

Add the input csv as 'nq-1m_bk.csv'. Input file must be in one-minute intervals
